## Data Models

### Current Models (Individual Assessment)
```typescript
interface Question {
  id: string
  text: string
  category: string
  order: number
}

interface ParticipantSession {
  surveyId: string
  participantId: string
  department: string
  responses: SurveyResponse[]
  currentQuestionIndex: number
  completedAt?: Date
  startedAt: Date
}

interface CategoryAverage {
  category: string
  average: number
  responses: number
}
```

### Planned Models (Organizational Assessment)
```typescript
interface OrganizationalAssessment {
  id: string
  organizationName: string    // "Stork"
  consultantId: string       // "guro@inbound.com"
  status: 'collecting' | 'ready' | 'locked'
  created: Date
  lockedAt?: Date
  
  // Anonymous aggregated data only
  managementResponses: AggregatedResponses
  employeeResponses: AggregatedResponses
  responseCount: { management: number, employee: number }
}

interface ParticipantResponse extends ParticipantSession {
  role: 'management' | 'employee'
  assessmentId: string
}
```

## Local Development Workflow

1. **Setup**: `npm run dev` starts local server
2. **Testing**: Navigate to `/survey/test` for survey flow
3. **Results**: View at `/results/test` after completing survey  
4. **Admin**: Manage data at `/admin`
5. **Data**: All stored in browser localStorage + JSON files

## Migration to Production

### Database Schema (Future Supabase)
```sql
-- Surveys table
CREATE TABLE surveys (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  name text NOT NULL,
  branding jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Questions table  
CREATE TABLE questions (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  survey_id uuid REFERENCES surveys(id),
  text text NOT NULL,
  category text,
  order_num integer
);

-- Responses table
CREATE TABLE responses (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  survey_id uuid REFERENCES surveys(id),
  participant_id uuid,
  department text,
  responses jsonb,
  completed_at timestamptz
);
```

### Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Supabase project setup
- [ ] Database migrations
- [ ] Environment variables configuration
- [ ] Vercel deployment pipeline
- [ ] Domain configuration
- [ ] SSL certificate setup

## Success Metrics
- Survey completion rate > 80%
- Mobile usability score > 90/100
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- Zero data loss in localStorage â†’ DB migration
- Admin interface usable without documentation

## Risk Mitigation
- **Data Loss**: localStorage backup to JSON export
- **Performance**: Lazy loading for charts, pagination for large datasets
- **Mobile Issues**: Extensive mobile testing, touch-optimized components
- **Browser Compatibility**: Fallbacks for localStorage, modern JS features

**Next Steps**: Begin Phase 1 with Next.js setup and core components.
