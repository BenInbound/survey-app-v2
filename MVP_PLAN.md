## Local Development Workflow (UX REDESIGNED)

1. **Setup**: `npm run dev` starts local server at http://localhost:3000 (consultant portal)
2. **Consultant Access**: Main homepage serves as consultant portal entry point
3. **Assessment Creation**: Create assessments at `/consultant/dashboard` with access code generation
4. **Survey Testing**: Use access codes to test survey flows at `/survey/[id]/access`
5. **Comparative Analytics**: View organizational insights at `/consultant/results/demo-org` (consultant-only)
6. **Admin**: Manage test data and development tools at `/admin`
7. **Security**: All surveys require access codes - no direct public links
8. **Data**: All stored in browser localStorage + JSON files (production: Supabase)

## Migration to Production

### Database Schema (Future Supabase)
```sql
-- Surveys table
CREATE TABLE surveys (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  name text NOT NULL,
  branding jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Questions table  
CREATE TABLE questions (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  survey_id uuid REFERENCES surveys(id),
  text text NOT NULL,
  category text,
  order_num integer
);

-- Responses table
CREATE TABLE responses (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  survey_id uuid REFERENCES surveys(id),
  participant_id uuid,
  department text,
  responses jsonb,
  completed_at timestamptz
);
```

### Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Supabase project setup
- [ ] Database migrations
- [ ] Environment variables configuration
- [ ] Vercel deployment pipeline
- [ ] Domain configuration
- [ ] SSL certificate setup

## Success Metrics
- Survey completion rate > 80%
- Mobile usability score > 90/100
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- Zero data loss in localStorage → DB migration
- Admin interface usable without documentation

## Risk Mitigation
- **Data Loss**: localStorage backup to JSON export
- **Performance**: Lazy loading for charts, pagination for large datasets
- **Mobile Issues**: Extensive mobile testing, touch-optimized components
- **Browser Compatibility**: Fallbacks for localStorage, modern JS features
