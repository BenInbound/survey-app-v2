# Implementation Plan

## Status
✅ **ALL PHASES COMPLETE** - Production-ready organizational assessment platform

## Key Features Implemented
- Mobile-first survey flow with 1-10 slider scoring
- Role-based access control (consultant, management, employee)  
- Access code security system
- Comparative analytics (management vs employee perspectives)
- 6 strategic question templates with 54 professional questions
- Per-assessment question customization
- AI-powered strategic insights
- Professional client presentation dashboards

## Technical Stack
- Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Chart.js for interactive spider charts
- OpenAI API for strategic insights
- localStorage (dev) → Supabase (production)

## Data Models
```typescript
interface OrganizationalAssessment {
  id: string
  organizationName: string
  consultantId: string
  status: 'collecting' | 'ready' | 'locked'
  accessCode: string
  managementResponses: AggregatedResponses
  employeeResponses: AggregatedResponses
  responseCount: { management: number, employee: number }
}
```

## Production Migration
Ready for Supabase migration when multi-device participant support is needed. Current localStorage implementation supports single-device demo and testing scenarios.
