# ðŸŽ¯ Comprehensive Departmental Analysis Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Problem Analysis & Solution Design

### Current UX Problems Identified
1. **Technical Assessment ID Exposure**: `/survey/[assessment-id]/access` requires participants to know internal system identifiers
2. **Distribution Complexity**: Consultants must explain both URL structure AND access codes
3. **Limited Strategic Insights**: Current role-only analysis (management vs employee) lacks departmental granularity for targeted interventions
4. **Consultant Feedback**: Colleague specifically requested "department to department" comparisons and enhanced text summaries

### Strategic Business Requirements
1. **Enhanced Consultant Value**: Enable department-specific strategic recommendations
2. **Targeted Intervention Capability**: Identify which departments need focused attention
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Understand if issues are organization-wide or department-specific
4. **Resource Prioritization**: Help consultants advise clients where to invest effort first
5. **Maintain Survey Integrity**: Zero survey friction while capturing departmental data

## Phase 2: Solution Architecture - Department-Embedded Access Codes

### Core Solution Approach
**Department-Embedded Access Code System**: Encode both role and department information directly in access codes, eliminating need for additional user inputs or URL complexity.

### Access Code Structure
```
Current:   STORK-MGMT-2025, STORK-EMP-2025
Enhanced:  STORK-MGMT-HR25, STORK-EMP-HR25, STORK-MGMT-ENG25, STORK-EMP-ENG25

Pattern: [ORG]-[ROLE]-[DEPT][YR]
- ORG: Organization identifier
- ROLE: MGMT (management) or EMP (employee)  
- DEPT: Department code (HR, ENG, SAL, OPS, etc.)
- YR: Year suffix for uniqueness
```

### URL Architecture (No Changes Required)
```
Current Flow: /access/[code] â†’ parse code â†’ route to /survey/[id]?role=[role]
Enhanced Flow: /access/[code] â†’ parse code â†’ route to /survey/[id]?role=[role] + store department

âœ… Same survey pages, same user experience
âœ… Same URL structure, same routing logic
âœ… Department tracking happens invisibly via access code parsing
```

## Phase 3: Data Model Enhancements

### Enhanced Assessment Model
```typescript
interface OrganizationalAssessment {
  // ... existing fields
  departments: Department[]           // NEW: Department configuration
  departmentAccessCodes: DepartmentAccessCode[]  // NEW: Generated codes
}

interface Department {
  id: string                         // "HR", "ENG", "SAL", "OPS"
  name: string                       // "Human Resources", "Engineering"
  managementCode: string             // "STORK-MGMT-HR25"
  employeeCode: string               // "STORK-EMP-HR25"
  expectedParticipants?: {           // Optional: for tracking
    management: number
    employee: number
  }
}
```

### Enhanced Response Model
```typescript
interface ParticipantResponse {
  // ... existing fields
  role: 'management' | 'employee'    // EXISTING
  department: string                 // NEW: Captured from access code
  assessmentId: string               // EXISTING
  responses: SurveyResponse[]        // EXISTING
}

interface AggregatedDepartmentData {
  department: string
  managementResponses: AggregatedResponses
  employeeResponses: AggregatedResponses
  responseCount: { management: number, employee: number }
  perceptionGaps: CategoryGap[]      // NEW: Mgmt vs Employee gaps by category
}
```
