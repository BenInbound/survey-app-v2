  organizationName: string
  isValid: boolean
  isExpired?: boolean
  expiresAt?: Date
}
```

**TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE**: The platform is now a production-ready consultant platform that protects professional relationships while maintaining powerful organizational strategic insights capabilities.

### Recent Fixes & Maintenance (August 2025)

#### ‚úÖ Access Code Flow Resolution
- **Issue Fixed**: Access code validation was failing due to demo assessment status mismatch
- **Root Cause**: Demo assessment was set to 'ready' status, but survey flow only allowed 'collecting' status
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - Modified survey initialization to accept both 'collecting' and 'ready' status (only blocking 'locked')
  - Added demo assessment status correction functionality
  - Enhanced debugging throughout access code validation flow
  - Fixed complete flow: Access Code Entry ‚Üí Role-Specific Landing ‚Üí Survey Completion

#### ‚úÖ Status Management Enhancement
- Assessment status now properly supports the full lifecycle:
  - **'collecting'**: Actively accepting new responses
  - **'ready'**: Has responses, allows additional responses for testing/late additions
