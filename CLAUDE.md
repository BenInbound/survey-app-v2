- OpenAI API integration for strategic insights (✅ Complete)
- Vercel deployment
- Role-based access control system
- Multi-participant assessment management

## Application Routes & User Flows (UX REDESIGNED)

### Current Routes (Post-UX Redesign + Privacy)
- `/` - **Consultant portal homepage** (primary entry point for platform users)
- `/survey/[id]/access` - **Access code entry page** (security gateway for surveys)
- `/survey/[id]` - **Role-specific survey landing pages** with company branding (`?role=management|employee`)
- `/survey/complete` - Role-appropriate completion pages
- `/consultant/dashboard` - Consultant control panel for creating assessments and managing access codes
- `/consultant/results/[assessmentId]` - **Full comparative organizational analytics** (consultant-only access)
- `/privacy/[assessmentId]` - **GDPR Privacy Notice** with assessment-specific information
- `/admin` - Admin portal for managing test data

### ⚠️ REMOVED ROUTES (UX Security & Privacy)
- ❌ `/management/results/[assessmentId]` - **ELIMINATED** to prevent organizational relationship damage
- ❌ `/results/[id]` - Individual assessment results moved to admin-only access
- ❌ All demo/individual assessment links removed from main navigation

### REDESIGNED User Flow (Production-Ready)

#### Consultant Workflow (Primary Platform Users)
1. **Consultant Portal** → Access main homepage (professional login/dashboard entry)
2. **Assessment Creation** → Create organizational assessment with unique access code generation
3. **Code Distribution** → Share access code with client contact for internal distribution
4. **Analysis & Presentation** → View full comparative analytics and present curated insights to management

#### Participant Workflow (Survey Recipients)
1. **Access Code Entry** → Participants receive code from company, enter on secure access page
2. **Role-Specific Landing** → Automatic redirect to appropriate landing page (employee vs management messaging)
3. **Survey Completion** → One-question-at-a-time flow with company branding
4. **Thank You Confirmation** → All participants receive thank you (NO results access for employees or management)

#### Distribution Strategy
1. **Consultant → Client Contact** → Shares assessment access code
2. **Client Contact → Internal Distribution** → Company distributes code via email/meetings/Slack
3. **Participants** → Use code to access appropriate survey experience
4. **Results Analysis** → Only consultant sees comparative data and insights

### Production Usage (GDPR-Compliant)
- Visit http://localhost:3000 (or current port) to access **Consultant Portal** (main entry point)
- **Consultant Authentication**: Both `/consultant/dashboard` and `/admin` require password: `INBOUND2025`
- Access consultant dashboard to create assessments and generate access codes
- Use `/admin` for development testing and data management
- Use `/admin/reset-demo` to reset demo data and ensure correct GDPR-compliant access codes
- Demo organizational assessment `demo-org` includes pre-populated responses with fixed access code: `DEMO-2025-STRATEGY`
- Access codes required for all survey access (no direct survey links)
- All data persists in localStorage until manually cleared via admin portal
- **GDPR Features**: Privacy metadata automatically attached to all data collection
- **Session Management**: Consultant sessions persist for 24 hours with automatic logout

### Important Notes for Demo Testing
- **Demo Assessment ID**: The platform uses a fixed ID `demo-org` for demo organizational assessments
- **Data Consistency**: Demo data auto-initializes on page load if not present
- **Results Access**: 
  - Individual results: `/results/stork-assessment`
  - Organizational results: `/consultant/results/demo-org`
- **Clear Data**: Use `/admin` portal to reset all test data if needed

## Data Models

### Current Data Models (Individual Assessment)

```typescript
interface Question {
  id: string
  text: string
  category: string
  order: number
}

interface ParticipantSession {
  surveyId: string
  participantId: string
  department: string
  responses: SurveyResponse[]
  currentQuestionIndex: number
  completedAt?: Date
  startedAt: Date
}

interface Survey {
  id: string
  name: string
  questions: Question[]
  branding: { name: string; primaryColor: string }
  createdAt: Date
}
```

### Current Data Models (Organizational Assessment)

```typescript
interface OrganizationalAssessment {
  id: string
  organizationName: string  // "Stork"
  consultantId: string     // "guro@inbound.com"
  status: 'collecting' | 'ready' | 'locked'
  created: Date
  lockedAt?: Date
  
  // Anonymous aggregated data only
  managementResponses: AggregatedResponses
  employeeResponses: AggregatedResponses
  responseCount: { management: number, employee: number }
}

interface ParticipantResponse extends ParticipantSession {
  role: 'management' | 'employee'
  assessmentId: string
}

interface AggregatedResponses {
  categoryAverages: CategoryAverage[]
  overallAverage: number
  // NO individual participant data stored for privacy
}
```

## Critical Requirements

### Core Survey Experience
- **Mobile-first design**: Survey interface must work seamlessly on mobile devices
- **Single question display**: Never show multiple questions simultaneously
- **Spider chart primary**: This is the key visualization output for client presentations
