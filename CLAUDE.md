# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **strategic organizational diagnosis platform** built for Inbound's consulting work with clients like Stork. It enables consultants to collect and analyze comparative feedback from both management and employees, identifying organizational perception gaps and strategic alignment issues across strategic dimensions during client strategy engagements.

## Key Project Documents

- `MVP_PLAN.md`: Detailed implementation plan with phases, tech stack, and timeline

## Commands

- `npm run dev` - Start development server at http://localhost:3000
- `npm run build` - Build production version
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm test` - Run Jest tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode

## Current Implementation Status (Phase 2 Complete)

**âœ… Phase 1 - Individual Assessment MVP:**

**ðŸ”„ Next Phase - Organizational Assessment Platform:**
- Role-based access control (consultant, management, employee)
- Multi-participant organizational assessments
- Comparative analytics (management vs employee perspectives)
- Assessment lifecycle management
- Anonymous response aggregation system

## Architecture Strategy

The project uses a **local-first development approach** that easily migrates to production:

### Current MVP Architecture
- Next.js 14 with App Router and TypeScript
- Local JSON file for questions (`/src/data/questions.json`)
- localStorage for response persistence
- Tailwind CSS for mobile-first responsive design
- Jest + Testing Library for comprehensive testing

### Production Migration Path
- Supabase (database + auth + storage)
- Chart.js for spider chart visualizations (âœ… Complete)
- OpenAI API integration for strategic insights (âœ… Complete)
- Vercel deployment
- Role-based access control system
- Multi-participant assessment management

## Application Routes & User Flows

### Current Routes (Phase 1-2)
- `/` - Homepage with assessment overview and start button
- `/survey/[id]` - Survey interface with spider chart and AI insights
- `/results/[id]` - Enhanced results dashboard with comparative visualization
- `/admin` - Admin portal for managing test data

### Planned Routes (Phase 3 - Organizational Assessment)
- `/consultant/dashboard` - Consultant control panel for creating assessments
- `/consultant/results/[assessmentId]` - Full comparative organizational analytics
- `/management/results/[assessmentId]` - Curated organizational health view
- `/survey/[id]?role=management|employee` - Role-aware survey experience

### Current User Flow (Individual Assessment)
1. **Homepage** â†’ User reads about assessment and clicks "Start Assessment"
2. **Survey** â†’ One-question-at-a-time flow with 1-10 slider, progress tracking, navigation  
3. **Results** â†’ Spider chart, AI insights, category scores, detailed responses
4. **Admin** â†’ View all sessions, clear test data, manage survey responses

### Planned User Flow (Organizational Assessment)
1. **Consultant** â†’ Creates assessment for organization (e.g., Stork)
2. **Distribution** â†’ Generates role-specific links for management + employees
3. **Collection** â†’ Management and employees take survey with role assignment
4. **Analysis** â†’ Consultant views comparative management vs employee insights
5. **Presentation** â†’ Management receives curated organizational health results

### Demo Usage
- Visit http://localhost:3000 to start
- Survey ID `stork-assessment` is pre-configured for testing
- All data persists in localStorage until manually cleared

## Data Models

### Current Data Models (Individual Assessment)

```typescript
interface Question {
  id: string
  text: string
  category: string
  order: number
}

interface ParticipantSession {
  surveyId: string
  participantId: string
  department: string
  responses: SurveyResponse[]
  currentQuestionIndex: number
  completedAt?: Date
  startedAt: Date
}

interface Survey {
  id: string
  name: string
  questions: Question[]
  branding: { name: string; primaryColor: string }
  createdAt: Date
}
```

### Planned Data Models (Organizational Assessment)

```typescript
interface OrganizationalAssessment {
  id: string
  organizationName: string  // "Stork"
  consultantId: string     // "guro@inbound.com"
  status: 'collecting' | 'ready' | 'locked'
  created: Date
  lockedAt?: Date
  
  // Anonymous aggregated data only
  managementResponses: AggregatedResponses
  employeeResponses: AggregatedResponses
  responseCount: { management: number, employee: number }
}

interface ParticipantResponse extends ParticipantSession {
  role: 'management' | 'employee'
  assessmentId: string
}

interface AggregatedResponses {
  categoryAverages: CategoryAverage[]
  overallAverage: number
  // NO individual participant data stored for privacy
}
```

## Critical Requirements

### Core Survey Experience
- **Mobile-first design**: Survey interface must work seamlessly on mobile devices
- **Single question display**: Never show multiple questions simultaneously
- **Spider chart primary**: This is the key visualization output for client presentations

### Organizational Assessment Platform
- **Role-based access control**: Consultants, management, and employees have different access levels
- **Anonymous response aggregation**: Individual employee responses not accessible to consultants
- **Comparative analytics**: Management vs employee perspective gap identification
- **Assessment lifecycle management**: Controlled data collection and presentation phases

### Privacy & Security
- **Anonymous by design**: Employee responses aggregated immediately, individual data not stored
- **Role-appropriate results**: Employees see thank you only, management sees curated insights, consultants see full analysis
- **Professional presentation**: All dashboards ready for client meetings without additional formatting

### Scalability & Reusability
- **Multi-client support**: Easy replication for future organizational assessments beyond Stork
- **Consultant-centric workflow**: Designed for consultants like Guro managing multiple client assessments

## Target Timeline

### âœ… Completed Phases
- **Phase 1** (Completed): Core survey flow with mobile-first design
- **Phase 2** (Completed): Spider chart visualization + AI strategic insights

### ðŸŽ¯ Current Target: Organizational Assessment Platform
Stork engagement target: **Week of September 2, 2025**

- **Phase 3a** (Days 1-2): Role-based infrastructure & consultant dashboard
- **Phase 3b** (Days 3-4): Comparative analytics & organizational results
- **Phase 3c** (Days 5-6): Management results view & role-appropriate access
- **Phase 3d** (Day 7): Complete experience testing & deployment

- Survey sessions managed by `SurveyManager` class in survey-logic.ts
- All responses persist in localStorage with key pattern `survey-session-{surveyId}`
- Data structure mirrors planned Supabase schema for easy migration

### Testing Coverage
- Comprehensive test suite covering all core functionality
- Component tests for SliderInput, ProgressBar, SpiderChart, and SummaryCard
- Logic tests for survey management, data persistence, and AI summary generation

- Tests run with Jest + Testing Library + jsdom

## Development Notes

### Current Status
The application has evolved from individual assessment MVP to advanced visualization platform. Phase 2 successfully implemented spider chart visualization and AI-powered strategic insights, creating a professional client presentation experience.

### Next Phase Focus
Phase 3 will transform this into a full organizational assessment platform enabling consultants like Guro to:
- Create assessments for client organizations (Stork)
- Collect anonymous feedback from both management and employees  
- Analyze organizational perception gaps and alignment issues
- Present curated results appropriate to each stakeholder role

### Technical Foundation
Current localStorage persistence enables immediate testing and demonstration without database setup. All data structures are designed for seamless Supabase migration when moving to production. The role-based access control system will maintain privacy-first design principles while providing powerful comparative analytics for consultants.

### OpenAI Integration
AI summary generation requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. See `.env.example` for setup instructions. The AI analysis is specifically tuned for organizational strategic insights rather than individual feedback.
